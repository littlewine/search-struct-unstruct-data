    "TREC Eval computes evaluation scores given two files: ground-truth information regarding relevant documents, named *query relevance* or *qrel*, and a ranking of documents for a set of queries, referred to as a *run*. The *qrel* will be supplied by us and should not be changed. For every retrieval model (or combinations thereof) you will generate a run of the top-1000 documents for every query. The format of the *run* file is as follows:\n",

    "   * `$query_identifier` is the unique identifier corresponding to a query (usually this follows a sequential numbering).\n",
    "   * `Q0` is a legacy field that you can ignore.\n",
    "   * `$document_identifier` corresponds to the unique identifier of a document (e.g., APXXXXXXX where AP denotes the collection and the Xs correspond to a unique numerical identifier).\n",
    "   * `$rank_of_document_for_query` denotes the rank of the document for the particular query. This field is ignored by TREC Eval and is only maintained for legacy support. The ranks are computed by TREC Eval itself using the `$query_document_similarity` field (see next). However, it remains good practice to correctly compute this field.\n",
    "   * `$query_document_similarity` is a score indicating the similarity between query and document where a higher score denotes greater similarity.\n",
    "   * `$run_identifier` is an identifier of the run. This field is for your own convenience and has no purpose beyond bookkeeping.\n",
    "   \n",
    "For example, say we have two queries: `Q1` and `Q2` and we rank three documents (`DOC1`, `DOC2`, `DOC3`). For query `Q1`, we find the following similarity scores `score(Q1, DOC1) = 1.0`, `score(Q1, DOC2) = 0.5`, `score(Q1, DOC3) = 0.75`; and for `Q2`: `score(Q2, DOC1) = -0.1`, `score(Q2, DOC2) = 1.25`, `score(Q1, DOC3) = 0.0`.

    "In this task you will experiment with applying distributional semantics methods ([LSI](http://lsa3.colorado.edu/papers/JASIS.lsi.90.pdf) **[5 points]** and [LDA](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/BleiNgJordan2003.pdf) **[5 points]**) for retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to implement LSI or LDA on your own. Instead, you can use [gensim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html). An example on how to integrate Pyndri with Gensim for word2vec can be found [here](https://github.com/cvangysel/pyndri/blob/master/examples/word2vec.py). For the remaining latent vector space models, you will need to implement connector classes (such as `IndriSentences`) by yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use a latent semantic model for retrieval, you need to:\n",
    "   * build a representation of the query **q**,\n",
    "   * build a representation of the document **d**,\n",
    "   * calculate the similarity between **q** and **d** (e.g., cosine similarity, KL-divergence).\n",
    "     \n",
    "The exact implementation here depends on the latent semantic model you are using. \n",
    "   \n",
    "Each of these LSMs come with various hyperparameters to tune. Make a choice on the parameters, and explicitly mention the reasons that led you to these decisions. You can use the validation set to optimize hyper parameters you see fit; motivate your decisions. In addition, mention clearly how the query/document representations were constructed for each LSM and explain your choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, you will first obtain an initial top-1000 ranking for each query using TF-IDF in **Task 1**, and then re-rank the documents using the LSMs. Use TREC Eval to obtain the results and report on `NDCG@10`, Mean Average Precision (`MAP@1000`), `Precision@5` and `Recall@1000`.\n",
    "\n",
